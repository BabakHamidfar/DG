### How to work with Definition plugin:
1.  If you want to add an image to the note of definition, a) Firstly the definition should made by a word on the first line. after the def -note was made you can open it and add any thing you want.
2. your defined word is followed immediately by a symbol (like a comma, period, or bracket) without a space
### There are some issues about using "note definition"

1. Punctuation and Symbols: The plugin's "word matcher" is very sensitive. **The "Space" Bug:** If your defined word is <font color="#ffff00">followed immediately by a symbol (like a comma, period, or bracket) without a space</font>, it often fails to recognize it.
2. Case Sensitivity: Atomic notes are often case-sensitive. If your file is named <font color="#ffff00">Ph</font>otosynthesis.md  but you write  <font color="#ffff00">ph</font>otosynthesis (lowercase) in your note, it may not trigger unless you add the lowercase version to the  aliases  property.
3. The "<font color="#ffff00">Context</font>" Restriction: Check if you accidentally set a **Context** for a specific note.
- If a note has the property def-context: [SomeOtherFile.md], it will **ignore** all your atomic definitions and only look at that one file.
- **Fix:** Look at the properties (frontmatter) of the note where it isn't working. If you see def-context , delete that line to restore the "global" view.
1. <font color="#ffff00">Cache</font> Lag (The Most Likely Culprit): When you create a new atomic note, the plugin doesn't always "see" it instantly.
- **The Fix:** You often have to manually trigger a refresh. Run the command Note Definitions: <font color="#ffff00">Refresh</font> Definitions from the Command Palette ( Cmd/Ctrl + P ).
- **The "Registered" Status:** Even if a file is in the correct folder, sometimes the plugin needs you to run Note Definitions: <font color="#ffff00">Register</font> atomic definition file while you have that specific atomic note open.
